What does a low AMH mean?,"Low AMH indicates reduced ovarian reserve, but it does not mean pregnancy is impossible. It may require higher medication doses or earlier IVF."
What is FSH and how does it affect fertility?,FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone) indicates how hard your brain must work to stimulate your ovaries. High FSH suggests lower ovarian reserve.
What is LH and why do doctors test it before IVF?,"LH helps regulate ovulation. Abnormal LH patterns are linked to PCOS, premature ovulation, or hormonal imbalance."

Why is thyroid (TSH) important for IVF?,Abnormal thyroid levels can affect ovulation and implantation. Most clinics prefer TSH to be under 2.5 before IVF.
Does low sperm count mean IVF is required?,Not always. Some cases respond to lifestyle changes or medications. But very low counts often require ICSI.
How long does it take to improve sperm quality?,"Sperm take 74 days to regenerate, so improvements are seen after about 3 months of lifestyle changes or supplements."
Should my partner abstain before providing the sample?,"Yes, ideally 2–5 days of abstinence is recommended for best-quality sperm."
Can I exercise during IVF stimulation?,"Light walking and stretching are fine. Avoid high-intensity workouts, jumping, and heavy lifting as ovaries enlarge."
What should I eat during IVF?,"A balanced diet with high protein, iron, folic acid, omega-3, and limited sugar. Staying hydrated is essential."
What are the risks involved in IVF?,"Risks include OHSS, infection, bleeding during retrieval, multiple pregnancy, or failed cycle"
Does IVF increase the chance of twins?,"Yes, especially if two embryos are transferred. Single-embryo transfer reduces this risk."
What factors affect IVF success rate?,"Age, AMH, sperm quality, embryo quality, uterine health, lifestyle, BMI, and clinic expertise."
Can I travel during IVF treatment?,"Short travel is fine, but avoid travelling on stimulation days and after embryo transfer unless your doctor approves."
Can I work during my IVF cycle?,"Yes. Most patients continue working, except on the egg retrieval day and the day after."
Is it normal to feel emotional or anxious during IVF?,"Yes. Hormones, stress, financial pressure, and uncertainty make this one of the most emotional treatments. Support from counsellors helps."
"What is ICSI, and when is it needed?",ICSI (Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection) is used mainly when sperm motility or count is low. A single sperm is injected directly into the egg.
What is blastocyst culture?,It means growing embryos to day 5–6 to identify stronger embryos. It may improve success rates in some patients.
How many embryos are usually transferred?,"Most clinics transfer 1 or 2 embryos, depending on age and embryo quality, to reduce the risk of twins."
Is the egg retrieval procedure painful?,"No. Egg retrieval is performed under light anesthesia, so you won’t feel pain during the procedure."
How long does an IVF cycle take from start to finish?,"A typical IVF cycle takes 4–6 weeks, including stimulation, egg retrieval, fertilization, and embryo transfer or freezing."
